# Use this pipeline to align a set of mitogenomes (and barcodes, if using) using one of our standard profiles, or to add a set of mitogenomes to a set of existing alignments.
# Your mitogenomes should be in a single genbank file
# If you have barcodes, these should be in a singe fasta file for each locus
# If you need to make multiple trees, e.g. for different groups, you'd run this pipeline separately on each genbank/fasta file

#        #
# SET UP #
#        #

# Create a new directory and place your mitogenomes and/or fasta file into it

# Make sure you have the scripts you need
# extract_genes.pl  translate.py   backtranslate.py   are all in /av/vls/biotools/

## GENE EXTRACTION ##

mkdir 1_nt_raw
extract_genes.pl -g yourmitogenomefile.gb -out 1_nt_raw/ -k -regiontypes CDS

## TRANSLATION ##

mkdir 2_aa_raw

# Translate all the individual gene files in 1_nt_raw in a loop with one command, putting the outputs into 2_aa_raw:
for file in 1_nt_raw/*; do translate.py 5 < $file > 2_aa_raw/${file#*/}; done

# NOTE: to run this on a single file, e.g. ATP6, you'd do
# translate.py 5 < 1_nt_raw/ATP6.fa > 2_aa_raw/ATP6.fa
# Swapping ATP6 for the name of each of the genes you have

## ALIGNMENT ##

mkdir 3_aa_aln

## Align all the individual gene files in 2_aa_raw in a loop with one command, putting the outputs into 3_aa_aln:
# For a profile alignment (where you want only your sequences, you're just using the profile to help align)
for file in 2_aa_raw/*; do mafft --addfragments $file --6merpair --anysymbol --thread 20 /av/MMGdatabase/0_AA_profiles/${file#*/} > 3_aa_aln/${file#*/}; done

# OR For an alignment where you're adding your sequences to an existing dataset
for file in 2_aa_raw/*; do mafft --addfragments $file --6merpair --anysymbol --thread 20 /path/to/existing/aa/alignments/${file#*/} > 3_aa_aln/${file#*/}; done


# NOTE: to run this on a single file, e.g. ATP6, you'd do
# mafft --addfragments 2_aa_raw/ATP6.fa --6merpair --anysymbol --thread 20 /av/MMGdatabase/0_AA_profiles/ATP6.fa > 3_aa_aln/ATP6.fa
# Swapping ATP6 for the name of each of the genes you have


## REMOVE PROFILE ##
# Obviously skip this step if you want to keep the existing data in the alignment.

cd 3_aa_aln

# Remove the profile from all of the individual gene files in 3_aa_aln in a loop with one command
for file in *; do mv $file ${file}_bak; perl -pe '$. > 1 and /^>/ ? print "\n" : chomp' ${file}_bak | grep -A 1 -P '^>(?!PROFILE::).*' > $file; rm ${file}_bak; done

# NOTE: to run this on a single file, e.g. ATP6, you'd do
# mv ATP6.fa > ATP6.fa_bak
# perl -pe '$. > 1 and /^>/ ? print "\n" : chomp' ATP6.fa_bak | grep -A 1 -P '^>(?!NC_).*' > ATP6.fa
# rm ATP6.fa_bak
# Swapping ATP6 for the name of each of the genes you have

## BACKTRANSLATE ##

mkdir 4_nt_aln

## Backtranslate all the individual gene files in 3_aa_aln in a loop with one command, putting the outputs into 3_nt_aln:
# If you aligned against a profile and have removed it
for file in 3_aa_aln/*; do backtranslate.py -i $file 1_nt_raw/${file#*/} 5 > 4_nt_aln/${file#*/}; done

# OR If you aligned against existing sequences and want to keep them
for file in 3_aa_aln/*; do cat /path/to/existing/nt/raw/${file#*/} 1_nt_raw/${file#*/} | backtranslate.py -i $file /dev/stdin 5 > 4_nt_aln/${file#*/}; done

# NOTE: to run this on a single file, e.g. ATP6, you'd do
# backtranslate.py -i 3_aa_aln/ATP6.fa 1_nt_raw/ATP6.fa 5 > 4_nt_aln/ATP6.fa
# Swapping ATP6 for the name of each of the genes you have

cp -Tr 4_nt_aln 5_nt_aln_final   # NB: -T treats directories as files, overwriting any contents that already exist

# For each barcode locus file that you have

mafft --addfragments yourbarcodefile.fa --6merpair --thread 20 4_nt_aln/thecorrespondinggenefile.fa > 5_nt_aln_final/thecorrespondinggenefile.fa

# FOR EXAMPLE if you have a set of COX1 barcodes
# mafft --addfragments yourbarcodefile.fa --6merpair --thread 20 4_nt_aln/COX1.fa > 5_nt_aln_final/COX1.fa
#

# IMPORTANT NOTE: if you intend to partition by codon, you will need to manually check the output file here to ensure that frame is still maintained

# If you a performing tree-building with a backbone that comprises all of your mitogenomes, and you're only interested in the placement of the barcodes,
# you can strip out unneeded columns from the alignments to save tree building time.
