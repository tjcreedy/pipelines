# Use this pipeline to annotate a set of mitogenomes in a fasta file. The first two major steps are fully
# automated, and the last step requires some manual work.

#        #
# SET UP #
#        #

# Create a new directory and place your mitogenome fasta file into it

# You need to ensure you have various scripts and programs. Some of these are from github, some from elsewhere. 
# You can acquire these scripts one of two ways. You can either clone the entire git repository to somewhere useful, in which case
# you will need to modify the command paths to point to these scripts. Or you can download each script to your current directory.

# To clone a repository, run the following line, replacing the author and repo parts with the relevant values
git clone https://github.com/author/repo.git 
# e.g.
git clone https://github.com/tjcreedy/biotools.git

# To download a single file, run the following line, replacing the author, repo, branch and name parts with the relevant values
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/author/repo/branch/name
# e.g.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylander/catfasta2phyml/master/catfasta2phyml.pl

# You also need MitoZ, which has several different installation methods (see https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/blob/master/version_2.3/INSTALL.md)
# We use as follows

# Install udocker
cd ~/
mkdir software
cd software
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker.git
(cd udocker/udocker; ln -s maincmd.py udocker)  
echo 'export PATH=~/software/udocker/udocker:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
udocker install   # if this doesn't work, log out and log in again

# Download MitoZ
udocker pull guanliangmeng/mitoz:2.3 # check and update the version number as necessary
udocker images # should see mitoz on this list

#                   #
# PREPARE YOUR FILE #
#                   #

# You should have a single fasta file with unique headers and no headers with more than 16 characters.


# Check your fasta has unique headers
grep "^>" file.fasta | sort | uniq -d 
# This shouldn't return anything - any headers that are returned are duplicated


#                          #
# RUN AUTOMATED ANNOTATION #
#                          #

# Split your fasta into separate files
mkdir split_fasta
perl split_fasta.pl -in mitogenomes.fasta -out split_fasta/

# Set up an alias for the long MitoZ command
alias mitoz="udocker run --rm --volume=$PWD --workdir=$PWD guanliangmeng/mitoz:2.3 /app/release_MitoZ_v2.3/MitoZ.py"

# Run MitoZ
mkdir mitoz_outputs/

for file in split_fasta/*
do
   n=${file%.fa}; n=${n#*/}; 
   mitoz annotate --clade Arthropoda --fastafile $file --outprefix $n --thread_number 10
   rm -rf tmp/
   cat $n.result/${n}_mitoscaf.fa.gbf >> annotated_contigs.gb
   mv $n.result mitoz_outputs
done

# Remove the automatic metadata (optional)
sed '/DEFINITION/,+17 d' annotated_contigs.gb > annotated_contigs_clean.gb

#                 #
# RUN MITOCORRECT #
#                 #

# You need to create a file that lists the paths to a set of alignment profiles, tab separated, e.g.:
# "ATP6  /path/to/aa_profiles/ATP6.fasta"
# "ATP8  /path/to/aa_profiles/ATP8.fasta"
# I assume this is called profilepaths.tsv

mitocorrect.py -s specifications.tsv -g annotated_contigs.gb -l name.log -a profilepaths.tsv  -o correctdir/ -t 10 -b 5 -c aa -r -m 0 -f

# Check out the repository documentation to understand this command!

#                 #
# ALIGN THE GENES #
#                 #

# Extract genes
mkdir 1_nt_raw

# Translate
mkdir 2_aa_raw
for file in 1_nt_raw/*
do
   translate.py 5 < $file > 2_aa_raw/${file#*/}
done

# Align to profiles

for file in 2_aa_raw/*
do
   mafft --addfragments $file --6merpair --anysymbol --thread 20 /path/to/aa_profiles/${file#*/} > 3_aa_aln/${file#*/}
done

#                #
# MANUALLY CHECK #
#                #

# Manually review the alignments and edit the contigs
