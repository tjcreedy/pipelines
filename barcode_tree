# This is a pipeline template for building a quick tree from barcode data from GenBank. 
# See the Wiki for more details on these steps and the concepts behind them - this document should act as a reference only.
# Note that the profile_annotation_phylogeny pipeline is generally more up-to-date and comprehensive than this one
# for most phylogenetic applications

# First, download some sequences from Genbank and place them in your working directory.
# I'm assuming this file is called sequences.gb. If you have multiple genbank files, you can just concatenate them together (cat file1.gb file2.gb > sequences.gb)

# Extract the gene sequences from these sequences
  # Create a directory to put the gene sequences in
mkdir extracted_genes 
extract_genes.pl -g sequences.gb -o extracted_genes/ -mincds 1 -d

# Copy the file for the gene you're interested in up to your working directory
  # You might need to change the name of the file!
mv extracted_genes/COX1.fa ./mygene.fa
  # Might as well delete any other extracted genes
rm -r extracted_genes

# Your sequences will be different lengths, we probably want to trim them down to a common region
  # Do an independent alignment
mafft --globalpair --maxiterate 1000 mygene.fa > mygene_all_globalign.fa
  # OR we have profiles for all mitochondrial genes that you can use to align to
mafft --addfragments mygene.fa --6merpair /av/MMGdatabase/0_NT_profiles/COX1.fa > mygene_all_profaln.fa

  # Download this alignment and open it in an alignment viewer such as aliview or geneious
  # If you used the profile, delete the profile sequences, these will be at the top of the alignment
  # Trim columns that fall before or after your sequence of interest
  # Check the translation of your sequences and make sure you know the reading frame
  # Save this (I'm assuming it's called mygene_trimmed_align.fa)
  # Delete all the gaps in the alignment (in aliview, edit > delete all gaps in all sequences)
  # Save this (I'm assuming it's called mygene_trimmed_unalign.fa) and upload it to the server

# Run the final alignment using translation
  # Translate your sequence, making sure you use the correct reading frame where it says RF (i.e. replace RF with 1, 2 or 3)
  # The 5 is the arthropod mitochondrial translation table
translate.py -r RF 5 < mygene_trimmed_unalign.fa > mygene_trimmed_unalign_aa.fa

  # Run alignment, either independent
mafft --globalpair --maxiterate 1000 --anysymbol mygene_trimmed_unalign_aa.fa > mygene_trimmed_aa_globaln.fa
  # OR against a profile
mafft --addfragments mygene_trimmed_unalign_aa.fa --6merpair --anysymbol /av/MMGdatabase/0_AA_profiles/COX1.fa > mygene_trimmed_aa_profaln.fa

  # Back translate into nucleotides (remember the reading frame, and change the input name depending on your alignment type)
backtranslate.py -r RF mygene_trimmed_unalign.fa 5 < mygene_trimmed_aa_globaln.fa > mygene_trimmed_nt_globaln.fa

  # If you used a profile alignment, make sure to remove the profile sequences from your alignment using an alignment viewer, or just a text editor.
  
  # You can now run a tree on this alignment. To do so in FastTree, run:
FastTree -gtr -nt < mygene_trimmed_nt_globaln.fa > mygene.nwk
  
 # Rename the tree (NB this command is superseded by phylabel.R
rename_newick_with_gb.pl -g sequences.gb -t mygene.nwk -o mygene_RN.nwk -fields LOCUS TAXONOMY -ntax 6
